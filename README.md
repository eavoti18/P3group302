# S.Q.U.A.T. - Squat Quest Ultimate Accurate Training
S.Q.U.A.T. is a processing program using RunwayML to track the human body. The program is made for people who want to improve their squat technique.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

To be able to use the program you will need to download Proecessing3 and RunwayML.
To download processing you just need to follow the link:[install Processing3](https://processing.org/download/)
You will also need to import the following libraries:
- Video Export together with ffmpeg from this link: [install Video Export](https://funprogramming.org/VideoExport-for-Processing/). when importing Video Export in the code it will look like this: 
```processing
import com.hamoid.*;
```
- oscP5 can be downloaded from inside Processing by following the path: sketch, import library..., add library..., and search for oscP5.
- processing video can also be downloaded from inside Processing you just have to search for video, and download the library made by Processing.
- runwayml can be downloaded through this link: [install runwayml library](https://runwayml.github.io/processing-library/)
- sound can be downloaded from inside Processing. download the library made by Processing.

To download RunwayML you just have to follow the instruction in the link [download RunwayML](https://learn.runwayml.com/#/getting-started/installation)
When starting RunwayML you will have to add PoseNet to you workspace by searching on PoseNet inside browse models. When running the program for the first time you will have to set it to run on file and then click "run locally", which will add the OSC mode.


## Running the tests

When running the program you will first have to run the RunwayML workspace on the OSC mode, and then run the Processing sketch.
